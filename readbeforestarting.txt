Hey ohohsn!

Thank you for ordering one of my services. I will help you through all the steps to get this bot up and running. First of all, make sure that you have selected
the folder inside the unzipped folder (they have the same name). This is because when unzipping a folder, the program makes a copy of that folder. Make sure
to select that folder with the same name inside the unzipped folder. 

To run this bot, you will need a few things. First of all, i recommend you to install visual studio code to run the bot (if you don't want that, no issue. CMD will do the job)
Now easily install node.js v16.6.2: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.6.2/ (install the one according to your os type)

After that, make sure to type "npm install" in your terminal (when having the folder selected)
Then easily go to config.json. In there, change your token: "TOKEN": "changeyourtokenhere",
example:  "TOKEN": "askfajg299259209skkf";

then go to line 277:
let role1 = message.guild.roles.cache.find(r => r.name === "yourexactrolenamehere");
and put your EXACT role name there!

if your role has emojis in the name, change the whole line to:
let role1 = message.guild.roles.cache.find(r => r.id === "yourroleidhere");

Now easily start the bot by typing: node . in the terminal.

If you want to change the embed titles and images, do this:

- go to index.js
find all the:
let helpembxd = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
		.setThumbnail("https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pc1QHXz430GLrg9v2X7eGR1KQ44=/0x0:1280x670/1200x800/filters:focal(538x233:742x437)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69026146/my_hero_academia_season_5_izuku_midoriya_deku_anime_1258627_1280x0.0.jpeg")
		.setColor("RANDOM")
		.setTitle("Eren Jaeger")
		.setFooter("React with ðŸ¥ª to start the timer")
etc etc and change the setTitle and the setThumbnail:

let helpembxd = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
		.setThumbnail("newimagelinkhere")
                .setColor("RANDOM")
		.setTitle("newnamehere")
		.setFooter("React with ðŸ¥ª to start the timer")

do that for all the other embeds and save the file and restart the bot again!
